## Without strategy pattern
- Here `Vehicle.java` is the parent and it has defined a method drive.
- `SportsVehicle.java` and `OffRoadVehicle.java` are using /Sports vehicle drive capability/ which is not in parent so we r not reusing the code but we r duplicating the code.

## WithStrategyPattern

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
